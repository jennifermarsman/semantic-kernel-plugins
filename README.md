# Semantic Kernel Plugins

Plugins are at the heart of unlocking more potential with your [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) applications.
They allow you to connect to external data sources and give large language models tools to be able to
interact with native functions and API services.

# Want to test your plugins? ‚öóÔ∏è

If you want to try out your plugins and you do not have a ChatGPT plus subscription or are off the waitlist, you can test this directly **for free** using the Semantic Kernel!

See [this tutorial doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chatgpt-plugins) or watch the [video](https://youtu.be/W_xF8PcdT78) for how to get set up.

# SK Plugins Hackathon #1 (7/18/23 - 7/25/23) üì¢

**What:** Build a Semantic Kernel Plugin and compete for glory and prizes!

**When:** Submissions are open July 18, 2023 2 PM PST to July 25, 2023 5 PM PST.

**Why:** Microsoft is standardizing around the [plugin architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins?tabs=Csharp) for all of its internal AI copilots
and encourage developers to use them for their own applications. This hackathon serves to jumpstart a larger plugin ecosystem that is valuable to the broader community.

**How:** Follow the getting started guides for creating a plugin
